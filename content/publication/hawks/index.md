abstract: We present heuristically optimal strategies expressed by deep learning agents playing a simple avoidance game. We analyse the learning and behaviour of two agents within a symmetrical grid world that must cross paths to reach a target destination without crashing into each other or straying off of the grid world in the wrong direction. The agent policy is determined by one neural network that is employed in both agents. Our findings indicate that the fully trained network exhibits behaviour similar to that of the game Hawks and Doves, in that one agent employs an aggressive strategy to reach the target while the other learns how to avoid the aggressive agent.
