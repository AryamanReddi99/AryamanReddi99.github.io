    summary: |
      My focus is on developing sample-efficient algorithms for exploration, coordination, and communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning using insights from game theory.

      I believe bridging the gap between practical deep learning and theoretical models of stochastic optimisation is essential for scaling RL in real-world MARL settings.
      
      I build algorithms which exhibit high performance in high-dimensional environments while providing mathematical insights using probability theory, linear algebra, calculus, & functional analysis.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a PhD student in reinforcement learning at the [LiteRL](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/rlcdm/team/) group at the Technical University of Darmstadt in partnership with the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) lab and [Hessian.AI](https://hessian.ai/), supervised by Professor [Carlo D'Eramo](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/rlcdm/team/carlo-deramo/) üéì

I am interested in developing sample-efficient techniques in **deep multi-agent reinforcement learning** using insights from **game theory** üïπÔ∏è

I am a [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis) skeptic, a [mereological universalist](https://philarchive.org/archive/SMITVA), and a [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) supporter.
